Line of the Day

This site allows users to post lines that they used that day.  They can then publish lines to groups, who can then provide commentary on the lines.

In addition to standard messaging, messages can be tagged with lines, comments, coaches or assignments.  The idea is to make progress in your skills of conversation!
