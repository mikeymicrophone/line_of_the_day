  	Hang it on your building's bulletin board, and at your local bars, cafes and supermarkets.  It will be fun!<hr>
    You can tell the clerks and business owners that a future version of the app will let users promote locations, a la <%= link_to 'Foursquare', 'http://foursquare.com' %>.<br>
    Planned features include both spontaneous mentions (check-in style) and future plans (e-vite style).<br>
    If their customers start using the app now, their businesses will be the first to benefit from this free publicity.  Also, their patrons will be chattier and flirtier!<hr>
    If they don't agree to display it prominently behind the bar, just surreptitiously hang it in the men's room ;)<hr>
    If you have an iPhone, iPod Touch, or iPad, <%= link_to 'install the app', 'http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/talktoher/id384896043' %> so you can show them a demo.  If your phone can play YouTube videos, <%= link_to "here's one you can show them", 'http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=44bTbEKATBc' %>.<hr>
    Lastly, <%= link_to 'here is the pitch.', :controller => 'talktoher', :action => :index %>
